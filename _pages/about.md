I am a Ph.D student of [North Carolina State University](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) and I am working as a Research Assistant at [WSPR Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu). My research focus lies on reverse engineering android apps and doing static program analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities. Currently I am developing a tool to detect payment fraud on android applications that exploit financial information in an improper way. I am also working in a project that studies internal inconsistencies among privacy policies of applications in Google Play store. I have prior experience of working as a Software Engineer at KONA Software Lab which provides secure payment solution to Banking and Financial institutions in Bangladesh. I am open for collaborating in my research domain so fell free to message if you are interested!
