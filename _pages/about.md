I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of [Computer Science] (https://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu) and I am working as a Research Assistant at [Wolfpack Security and Privacy Lab](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu). I am advised by [Dr. William Enck](https://www.enck.org). My research interests broadly fall within the areas of systems security and privacy, currently with a focus on analyzing and improving the security of mobile payment systems and protocols. 

Previously, I worked at [KONA] (https://konai.com), where I developed mobile payment solutions for both android and iOS platforms and before that, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/). 

I am open for collaborating in my research domain so fell free to message if you are interested!
